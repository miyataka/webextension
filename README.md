## Features

- Check that request/response includes credentials
- DevTools integration

## Motivation

Everyone makes mistakes.

A developer sometimes expose own credentials like OAuth token in a website accidentally.

[secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) can found credentials in file.
However, The exposed credentials come from environments variables or Database, so These are not embed in a file.

We want to found these exposed credentials.

Security research use proxy software like [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp), but web developer use DevTools instead of it.

Secretlint WebExtension integrate to DevTools in Chrome/Firefox.
Secretlint WebExtension help web developer to notice exposed credential.
